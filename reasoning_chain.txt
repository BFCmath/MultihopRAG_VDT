Original Question: Between the TechCrunch report on Epic Games' antitrust battle with Google published on November 6, 2023, and the TechCrunch report on a news publisher filing a class action antitrust suit against Google published on December 15, 2023, was there consistency in the portrayal of Google's anticompetitive allegations?
Current Facts:
- The TechCrunch report on November 6, 2023, portrayed Google's anticompetitive allegations in the Epic Games battle as related to its Android app store (Google Play) and commission structure, with implications of evidence destruction.

Original Question: Between the TechCrunch report on Epic Games' antitrust battle with Google published on November 6, 2023, and the TechCrunch report on a news publisher filing a class action antitrust suit against Google published on December 15, 2023, was there consistency in the portrayal of Google's anticompetitive allegations?
