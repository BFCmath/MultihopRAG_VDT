Original Question: Between the TechCrunch report on Epic Games' antitrust battle with Google published on November 6, 2023, and the TechCrunch report on a news publisher filing a class action antitrust suit against Google published on December 15, 2023, was there consistency in the portrayal of Google's anticompetitive allegations?
Current Facts:
- The TechCrunch report on November 6, 2023, portrayed Google's anticompetitive allegations in the Epic Games battle as related to its Android app store (Google Play) and commission structure, with implications of evidence destruction.

Original Question: Between the TechCrunch report on Epic Games' antitrust battle with Google published on November 6, 2023, and the TechCrunch report on a news publisher filing a class action antitrust suit against Google published on December 15, 2023, was there consistency in the portrayal of Google's anticompetitive allegations?

Original Question: Does the 'Essentially Sports' article suggest that the NBA's Christmas games are secure regardless of the NFL's decisions, while the 'FOX News - Lifestyle' article discusses the impact of parents using Christmas as a bribe, without mentioning any potential threat to the NBA's Christmas dominance?
Current Facts:
- The 'Essentially Sports' article suggests that the NFL's recent decisions could threaten the NBA's stronghold on Christmas Day games, indicating they are not secure regardless of NFL decisions.
- The 'FOX News - Lifestyle' article discusses parents using Christmas, or "the Santa bribe," as a form of bribery, which a parenting expert considers a mistake that lowers parenting standards and shifts the focus of Christmas to selfish gain; the article does not mention any potential threat to the NBA's Christmas dominance.

Current Facts:
- 'Fortune' articles describe Sam Bankman-Fried's actions as including making false and misleading statements online and in interviews, not inquiring about missing funds, and exhibiting arrogance, with evidence against him including his own words and co-conspirator testimony.
- 'TechCrunch' describes Sam Bankman-Fried's actions as exhibiting arrogance, making false and misleading statements online and in interviews, pointing the finger at others, being willing to give up his personal wealth for customers, and torpedoing his own credibility during testimony by being overly narrative.
- The 'Fortune' article's primary focus and analytical scope involves examining Sam Bankman-Fried's character flaws, his actions, the evidence presented against him, his testimony, the conflicting narratives presented in court, and the question of his guilt, with the ultimate determination lying with the jury.

d that Alameda owed FTX about $11 billion. FTX’s revenue at the time was about $1.5 billion.

Ellison, Singh, Wang, and Bankman-Fried met in the Bahamas office. Alameda’s lenders wanted their money back, and Bankman-Fried directed the group to pay back the lenders using FTX customer funds.

n Fantasy makes sense. But it's hard to see the good in his game so far this season beyond him finding holes in zone coverage. Jonnu even has more red-zone targets than Pitts (by one, three to two).

I'd rather start Jake Ferguson, Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert.

Passage:Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in.

Thursday also brought in testimony from Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner at crypto investment firm Paradigm. That firm invested $278 million in FTX across 2021 and 2022, and is part of a class-action lawsuit accusing it and others of defrauding customers by promoting FTX.

SBF trial: What we learned in the week one

As expected, the opening statements in the SBF trial were spicy. The prosecution painted a picture of an empire “built on lies” and made a point to show actual pictures of SBF alongside rich and powerful figures to illustrate the peak of his power and influence prior to FTX’s implosion.

“This man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people,” prosecutor Thane Rehn told the court. “He defrauded sophisticated investors and lenders, and he...

FTX’s collapse

Concerns surrounding FTX’s liquidity grew after CoinDesk published a copy of Alameda’s balance sheet, showing the firm held $14.6 billion in assets and $8 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2022.

You know what’s cooler than a vampire story? A story that’s not a vampire story, but surprise — it has vampires.

The surprise vampire is a rich tradition, unfolding across many different media intended for all kinds of audiences. Sometimes it is a prominent part of a story that’s made richer for the unexpected presence of a bloodsucker.

Metal Gear Solid 2: Vamp

The Metal Gear Solid games are kings of the nonchalant narrative curveball. It’s a series that takes great care to ground itself in near-future militaristic realism and hard sci-fi, only to suddenly introduce a man made of bees and a cyborg ninja. Vamp is one of those curveballs, the member of a rogue special forces unit with a superhuman resistance to injury, the ability to run on water, and a taste for blood — with an eerie origin story for that hunger, to boo...

Like a lot of ideas in the Matrix movies, a seemingly throwaway line leads to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it scene with wild implications for everything you’re looking at. In The Matrix, The Oracle tells Neo that things that go bump in the night are in fact real, the result of a program misbehaving, an error in the virtual world of The Matrix. In The Matrix Reloaded, we meet some of those misbehaving programs in the form of the Merovingian’s henchmen. ...
